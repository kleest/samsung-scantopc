suld-scantopc (0.4.3) stable; urgency=low

  * improvements in error handling and logging
  * first try of an option to avoid caching of scanner object (which
    works), but closing the scanner session (to make the scanner
    available to other servers that are registered at the scanner)
    causes a seg fault (poor programming of C based sane extension?)

samsungmfp-scantopc (0.3.0-1) precise; urgency=low

  * fixed dependency issue with python-pysnmp* on ubuntu quantal (12.10)

 -- Totally King <totally-king@web.de>  Wed, 03 Apr 2013 10:38:22 +0200

samsungmfp-scantopc (0.3.0) stable; urgency=HIGH

  * added modified sane module classes to enable multipage scanning on
    CLX-3305W (can be disabled in config file). Modifications involve
    TCP and UDP man in the middle proxy communication with the scanner, 
    since the needed commands are not implemented in the SANE backend.
    This can be deactivated in the config file, reverting to the original
    unmodified sane module (probably better for other devices).
  * revised logging code, so that it supports multiple processes and all
    of them writing to a rotating log file
  * some reorganization of code that (hopefully) makes more sense
  * bugfix: scan size is not ignored anymore
  * automatic 90Â° clockwise rotation of images that are scanned 'Rotated'

samsungmfp-scantopc (0.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now checking for errors when unregistering server.
  * Restructured refreshServer function to actually do refreshing work.

 -- Totally King <totally-king@web.de>  Sun, 17 Mar 2013 15:14:39 +0100

samsungmfp-scantopc (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * bugfix of non responsive server after canceling or waiting too long
    in 'scan to pc' menu on printer

 -- Totally King <totally-king@web.de>  Fri, 15 Mar 2013 15:13:56 +0100

samsungmfp-scantopc (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * added sudoers file so users of group lp can now
    'sudo service samsungScannerServer start' and the like
    without password confirmation
  * complete rewrite of method to generate unique IDs that are used
    to identify the server in the printer. The former method used the last
    8 characters of server name and hostname in hex encoding which could 
    lead to name collisions if server name and hostname were identical.
    New method involves md5 hashing of whole server name and hostname to 
    minimize the risk of collisions in unique IDs.
  * server process can now handle signals like SIGTERM to unregister 
    itself from the printer and remove the PID file (if it still exists)
    when terminated e.g. by 'sudo service samsungScannerServer stop'

 -- Totally King <totally-king@web.de>  Wed, 13 Mar 2013 15:13:37 +0100

samsungmfp-scantopc (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * bugfix of index error in user options: 1->0, 2->1, 3->2 etc.
  * image files are now put by default in $HOME/Scans/ of whichever
    OWNER you specify in config file (default: user with uid 1000)
  * files are also changed to be owned by that user, not root
  * bugfix of name error when trying to use a filter
  * automatic handling of all station specific options in config file
    if they are not given there (SCANNER_SANE_NAME, PRINTER_IP,
    SERVER_NAME, OWNER, OWNER_UID)
  * file scheme is now different: no more same file id but different
    extension, e.g. if SCAN_2013-03-09__01.jpg exists the next PDF is 
    named SCAN_2013-03-09__02.pdf
  * added some more descriptive messages in log and some hopefully
    better error messages
  * only uncommented lines of config file are printed to log
  * some code clean up for better understanding
  * added possibility to run 'from scannerServer import *' from (i)python
    session without starting the server but still able to test out
    functions and so on
